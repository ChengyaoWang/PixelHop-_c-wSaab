###Warning
The code is still under construction

### Introduction
This is implementation by Chengyao Wang

OOP / Numpy version is an modified version of Yifan Wang's [EE569_2020Spring] (https://github.com/USC-MCL/EE569_2020Spring)

FP / Pyspark version is an modified version of Min Zhang's [PointHop++] (https://github.com/minzhang-1/PointHop-PointHop2_Spark)

Original Paper [PixelHop++: A Small Successive-Subspace-Learning-Based (SSL-based) Model for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03141)

Note that this is not the official implementation.

### Major Dependencies
Numpy, Scikit-Learn, pyspark, pytorch / tensorflow (for CIFAR10 dataset)
